#### Graph Reordering

##### 1. Boldi and Vigna 

* Compress web graphs using a `lexicographical order` of the URLs. 
* Relies on two properties: locality and similarity.

##### 2. Apostolico and Drovandi

* Assuming no a priori knowledge of the graph.
* Based on a `breadth-first traversal` of the graph vertices and achieves a better compression rate using an entropy-based encoding.
